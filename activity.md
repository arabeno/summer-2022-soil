I spent quite a while trying to get the actual photos into Gitlab using the Web IDE it provides. I eventually gave up on that and just cloned everything to my machine so I could upload all 359 photos a little easier (versus doing it one photo at a time). I renamed and resized all the images (since they didn't need to be 4000 by 6000 pixels, and the large image sizes made upload times take forever). Trying to wrangle the images took the most time. 

Overall, today I:
* Set up the Gitlab where you're reading this
* Renamed, resized, and uploaded all the soil images to this repository
* Tried running a couple images on the sample KerasV3 Colab, copied to my own Lehigh Google Drive. [Link here.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16e8fGO9hrRz9-6FhqvkHh6l8k6CMg4QZ?usp=sharing)

I tried swapping out the image that was being evaluated in the aforemention Colab several times to see if any better results were given. I'm not sure if it's just because the photos are lower resolution, but the model is having a terrible time trying to segment anything in the image. I'll see if I can find another pre-trained model that may work better.

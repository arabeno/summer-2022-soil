# Summer 2022 Soil

This repo is for my implementation of basic ML/Colab usage to segment images of soil. As of 7/7/22, I've uploaded 359 of these photos, each resized from their original 4000 x 6000 size to 450 x 600. This was mostly to reduce upload times (and having the images be that large wasn't really necessary).

## Resources Used

The current pre-trained model I'm trying to use is the [Keras DeepLab v3 Plus model][1]. To be honest, it hasn't done a fantastic job with the couple photos I've tried.
I've also been following along with *most of* the [Udacity Intro to Tensorflow online course][2].

## Goals
* Attempt basic machine learning training on image segmentation
* Have, at the very least, a proof of concept/basic implementation by ~ July 20th.
